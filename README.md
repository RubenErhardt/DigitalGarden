# 🌱 Digital Garden – Frontend Internship Project

## 📌 About this Project

**Digital Garden** is a personal project I created during my internship at Cosmetique Totale. It serves as a **living knowledge base**, a **technical playground**, and a way to explore and document my frontend development journey. The project is built with **SvelteKit**, focusing on performance, accessibility, and maintainability using modern web standards.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Collect and organize development insights, notes, and patterns.
- Create reusable UI components with real-world application.
- Test modern frontend techniques and integrations.
- Showcase my ability to combine design, code, and structure effectively.
- Build a system that grows with my knowledge—just like a real garden.

## 🧠 Why it Matters

This Digital Garden is more than a project—it's a digital reflection of how I think, learn, and grow as a frontend developer. It’s a tool to stay curious, make mistakes, document wins, and experiment freely. Through this project, I demonstrate the ability to connect technologies, structure information, and keep development joyful.
