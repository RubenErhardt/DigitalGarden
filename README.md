# 🌱 Digital Garden – CMD Internship Project

## 📌 About this Project

**Digital Garden** is a personal project I created during my internship at Cosmetique Totale. It serves as a **living knowledge base**, a **technical playground**, and a way to explore and document my frontend development journey. The project is built with **SvelteKit**, focusing on performance, accessibility, and maintainability using modern web standards.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Collect and organize development insights, notes, and patterns.
- Create reusable UI components with real-world application.
- Test modern frontend techniques and integrations.
- Showcase my ability to combine design, code, and structure effectively.
- Build a system that grows with my knowledge—just like a real garden.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Markdown-powered knowledge base** with SvelteKit routing.
- **Interactive UI elements**, such as toggles, filters, and animated loaders.
- **Progressive enhancement**: core functionality remains accessible without JS.
- **Custom loader** with fade-in/out animation and branding.
- **Semantic HTML & accessibility-first**: fully keyboard- and screen reader-friendly.
- **Mobile-first design** with flexible layouts and scaling components.

## 🌿 Future Plans

- **Git-based publishing system**  
  Integrate a commit-based workflow to add new notes and auto-generate pages.

- **Graph-based visual overview**  
  Introduce a mind-map style interface to show relationships between concepts or components.

- **Interactive code playgrounds**  
  Embed live-editable code snippets for prototyping or demo purposes using `svelte-repl`.

- **Personal tagging system**  
  Build a custom tagging UI and filter logic to categorize notes by topic or framework.

- **Progress tracker / learning log**  
  Add a journal-like feature to reflect on weekly learning milestones.

- **PWA support**  
  Make the garden installable and available offline to encourage continuous writing.

## 🧠 Why it Matters

This Digital Garden is more than a project—it's a digital reflection of how I think, learn, and grow as a frontend developer. It’s a tool to stay curious, make mistakes, document wins, and experiment freely. Through this project, I demonstrate the ability to connect technologies, structure information, and keep development joyful.
